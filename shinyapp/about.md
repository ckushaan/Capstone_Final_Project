This application is developed as part of the requirement for the **Coursera Data Science Capstone Course**. The goal of the project is to build a predictive text model combined with a shiny app UI that will predict the next word as the user types a sentence similar to the way most smart phone keyboards are implemented today using the technology of Swiftkey.

### Steps
1. Upon initial load up of the application, **"NULL"** will be displayed at the 'Next word predict' as textbox.
2. User may then start entering a phase to begin the next word prediction.


### Results
1. Next word predicted is shown at the 'Next word predict as' textbox.
2. Information on the n-gram back of the algorithm used to predict is shown as indication.
